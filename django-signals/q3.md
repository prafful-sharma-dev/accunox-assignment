# Django Signals - Question 3

## Do Django signals run in the same database transaction as the caller?

**Answer:**  
Yes, by default Django signals run in the **same database transaction** as the caller if the signal is sent within an atomic block.

## Example Code

```python
from django.db import transaction
from django.dispatch import Signal
import django.db

# Define a custom signal
my_signal = Signal()

def my_receiver(sender, **kwargs):
    # Check if we're in an atomic transaction block
    in_atomic = django.db.connection.in_atomic_block
    print("Receiver in_atomic_block:", in_atomic)

# Connect the receiver to the signal
my_signal.connect(my_receiver)

def main():
    # Outside any transaction block
    print("Before transaction, in_atomic_block:", django.db.connection.in_atomic_block)
    
    with transaction.atomic():
        print("Inside transaction before sending signal, in_atomic_block:", django.db.connection.in_atomic_block)
        my_signal.send(sender=main)
    
    print("After transaction, in_atomic_block:", django.db.connection.in_atomic_block)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()

# Django Signals - Question 1

## Are Django signals executed synchronously or asynchronously by default?

**Answer:**  
Django signals are executed **synchronously** by default. This means that when you send a signal, the connected receivers are called immediately, and the caller waits until they finish.

## Example Code

```python
import time
from django.dispatch import Signal

# Define a custom signal
my_signal = Signal()

def my_receiver(sender, **kwargs):
    print("Receiver started")
    time.sleep(1)  # Simulate a delay
    print("Receiver finished")

# Connect the receiver to the signal
my_signal.connect(my_receiver)

def main():
    print("Before sending signal")
    my_signal.send(sender=main)  # Signal sent synchronously
    print("After sending signal")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()

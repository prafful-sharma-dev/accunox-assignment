# Django Signals - Question 2

## Do Django signals run in the same thread as the caller?

**Answer:**  
Yes, by default Django signals run in the **same thread** as the caller.

## Example Code

```python
import threading
from django.dispatch import Signal

# Define a custom signal
my_signal = Signal()

def my_receiver(sender, **kwargs):
    print("Receiver thread id:", threading.get_ident())

# Connect the receiver to the signal
my_signal.connect(my_receiver)

def main():
    print("Main thread id:", threading.get_ident())
    my_signal.send(sender=main)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
